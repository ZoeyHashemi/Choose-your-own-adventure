Persian Tales: The Wolf and the Goat
If you know the European fairy tale about the "Wolf and the Seven Kids" (a story in the Brothers Grimm unit for this class), you will recognize some elements of this story. Even though the story is in English translation here, it manages to convey the fun and charm of the original with the rhyming words the characters use to confront each other, along with sounds effects!

Be aware of the word ash: this is the name of a Persian soup! You can read more about Persian ash (pronounced "aash," rhyming with English "gosh"), at Wikipedia.

The Wolf and the Goat

Once upon a time there was a time when there was no one but God.

There was a goat who had four children, one was Alil, one was Balil, one was Ginger Stick, and the fourth was Black Eyes.

One day she said: "Sit quietly here, children; I'm going off to bring grass for you. If the wolf should come and knock, don't open the door for him. And if he says: 'I am your mother,' say: 'Put your hand in at the crack of the door,' and if you see that the hand is black, don't open the door, but if you see a red hand you'll know that it's your mother back again."

Now the wolf had all the time been listening, and as soon as the goat was gone he dyed his hand with henna to make it red, and came and knocked at the door. They called out: "Who's that?"

"Open the door, I've brought grass for you," said he.

"Show us your hand."

The wolf shoved his hand in at the crack of the door, and when they saw that it was red they opened the door and let him in. So he carried off Alil and Balil and Ginger Stick, but Black Eyes ran away and hid.
