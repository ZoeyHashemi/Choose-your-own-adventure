Persian Tales: The Wolf and the Goat
If you know the European fairy tale about the "Wolf and the Seven Kids" (a story in the Brothers Grimm unit for this class), you will recognize some elements of this story. Even though the story is in English translation here, it manages to convey the fun and charm of the original with the rhyming words the characters use to confront each other, along with sounds effects!

Be aware of the word ash: this is the name of a Persian soup! You can read more about Persian ash (pronounced "aash," rhyming with English "gosh"), at Wikipedia.
