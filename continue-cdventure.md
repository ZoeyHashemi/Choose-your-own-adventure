Black Eyes, filled with determination, walked alongside his mother as they ventured deeper into the mysterious forest. The path split into two directions, each offering its own risks.

On one side, a trail of glowing footprints led into a mist-covered valley. The light was faint but seemed to promise secrets waiting to be uncovered. Black Eyes felt a strange pull toward the mist.

On the other side, the forest grew darker, and in the distance, the faint outline of their home could be seen. His mother gently nudged him, suggesting they return home after such a long and dangerous journey. "We can always explore again another day, my dear," she said softly.

Now, Black Eyes had to make a decision.
