Black Eyes, feeling brave after the encounter with the wolf, decided to go on a solo adventure. As he ventured into the forest, he heard a rustling in the bushes. His heart pounded, but he knew he had to face whatever lay ahead.

Suddenly, to his surprise, it was not a stranger but his mother, the goat, emerging from the bushes. She looked worried but relieved to see him.

"My child," she said, "Iâ€™ve been searching for you. The forest is dangerous, and I fear the wolf may not be the only threat here. We must decide what to do next."
