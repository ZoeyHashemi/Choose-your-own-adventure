Black Eyes stood at the edge of the well, her heart pounding. She couldn't shake the feeling that the voice was familiar, so she called out, "Who’s there? Is it you, Alil? Balil? Ginger Stick?"

The voice, now a bit clearer but still weak, responded, "It's... it's me... Alil. I’m trapped down here. Please help me."

Without thinking, Black Eyes grabbed a nearby vine, tying it to a tree for support. She lowered herself carefully into the dark, cold well. As she descended, the walls seemed to close in around her, and the air grew damp and heavy.

When she finally reached the bottom, she could barely make out the silhouette of a small figure. But as she stepped closer, her heart sank. This was not her brother. It was the wolf, hiding in the shadows, waiting to trap her.

The wolf growled, "You’ve fallen right into my trap, little one."

What should Black Eyes do?
