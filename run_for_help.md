Black Eyes quickly dashed out of the house, her heart racing. She remembered her motherâ€™s warning and knew she had to find help. As she ran through the forest, she came across....
an old, abandoned well. The stones around it were cracked, covered in moss, and the air grew still as she approached. Black Eyes hesitated for a moment, wondering if anyone could still be living nearby. Just as she was about to turn away, she heard a faint voice calling from the depths of the well.

"Help... help me..."

Her heart skipped a beat. The voice sounded weak, but familiar. Could it be one of her missing siblings? She peered into the well, seeing only darkness.

What should Black Eyes do?
- ** Call out to the voice in the well**: Go to The Voice in the Well
- ** Ignore the voice and continue running deeper into the forest**: Go to Deeper into the Forest
